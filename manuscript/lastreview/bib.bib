    abstract = "{Despite great increase of the amount of data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS), the genetic background of a partially heritable Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is not fully understood yet. Machine learning methods are expected to help researchers in the analysis of the large number of SNPs possibly associated with the disease onset. To date, a number of such approaches were applied to genotype-based classification of AD patients and healthy controls using GWAS data and reported accuracy of 0.65–0.975. However, since the estimated influence of genotype on sporadic AD occurrence is lower than that, these very high classification accuracies may potentially be a result of overfitting. We have explored the possibilities of applying feature selection and classification using random forests to WGS and GWAS data from two datasets. Our results suggest that this approach is prone to overfitting if feature selection is performed before division of data into the training and testing set. Therefore, we recommend avoiding selection of features used to build the model based on data included in the testing set. We suggest that for currently available dataset sizes the expected classifier performance is between 0.55 and 0.7 (AUC) and higher accuracies reported in literature are likely a result of overfitting.}",

abstract="Machine learning methods, such as Random Forest (RF), have been used to predict disease risk and select a set of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated to the disease on Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS). In this study, we extracted information from biological networks for selecting candidate SNPs to be used by RF, for predicting and ranking SNPs by importance measures. From an initial set of genes already related to a disease, we used the tool GeneMANIA for constructing gene interaction networks to find novel genes that might be associated with Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Therefore, it is possible to extract a small number of SNPs making the application of RF feasible. The experiments conducted in this study focus on investigating which SNPs may influence the susceptibility to AD.",

abstract = {As more people live longer, age-related neurodegenerative diseases are an increasingly important societal health issue. Treatments targeting specific pathologies such as amyloid beta in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) have not led to effective treatments, and there is increasing evidence of a disconnect between traditional pathology and cognitive abilities with advancing age, indicative of individual variation in resilience to pathology. Here, we generated a comprehensive neuropathological, molecular, and transcriptomic characterization of hippocampus and two regions cortex in 107 aged donors (median = 90) from the Adult Changes in Thought (ACT) study as a freely-available resource (http://aging.brain-map.org/). We confirm established associations between AD pathology and dementia, albeit with increased, presumably aging-related variability, and identify sets of co-expressed genes correlated with pathological tau and inflammation markers. Finally, we demonstrate a relationship between dementia and RNA quality, and find common gene signatures, highlighting the importance of properly controlling for RNA quality when studying dementia.},

While previous studies have identified numerous genetic variants associated with IOP, these loci only explain a fraction of IOP heritability. Recently established of biobank repositories have resulted in large amounts of data, enabling the identification of the remaining heritability for complex traits. Here, we describe the largest genome-wide association study of IOP to date using participants of European ancestry from the UK Biobank. We identified 671 directly genotyped variants that are significantly associated with IOP (P \\&lt; 5 × 10−8). In addition to 103 novel loci, the top ranked novel IOP genes are LMX1B, NR1H3, MADD and SEPT9. We replicated these findings in an external population and examined the pleiotropic nature of these loci. These discoveries not only further our understanding of the genetic architecture of IOP, but also shed new light on the biological processes underlying glaucoma.}",

TITLE={The Unifying Hypothesis of Alzheimer’s Disease: Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycans/Glycosaminoglycans Are Key as First Hypothesized Over 30 Years Ago},
JOURNAL={Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience},      
VOLUME={13},

DOI={10.3389/fnagi.2021.710683},      
ISSN={1663-4365},   

ABSTRACT={The updated “Unifying Hypothesis of Alzheimer’s disease” (AD) is described that links all the observed neuropathology in AD brain (i.e., plaques, tangles, and cerebrovascular amyloid deposits), as well as inflammation, genetic factors (involving ApoE), “AD-in-a-Dish” studies, beta-amyloid protein (Aβ) as a microbial peptide; and theories that bacteria, gut microflora, gingivitis and viruses all play a role in the cause of AD. The common link is the early accumulation of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) and heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). HS GAG accumulation and/or decreased HS GAG degradation is postulated to be the key initiating event. HS GAGs and highly sulfated macromolecules induce Aβ 1–40 (but not 1–42) to form spherical congophilic maltese-cross star-like amyloid core deposits identical to those in the AD brain. Heparin/HS also induces tau protein to form paired helical filaments (PHFs). Increased sulfation and/or decreased degradation of HSPGs and HS GAGs that occur due to brain aging leads to the formation of plaques and tangles in AD brain. Knockout of HS genes markedly reduce the accumulation of Aβ fibrils in the brain demonstrating that HS GAGs are key. Bacteria and viruses all use cell surface HS GAGs for entry into cells, including SARS-CoV-2. Bacteria and viruses cause HS GAGs to rapidly increase to cause near-immediate aggregation of Aβ fibrils. “AD-in-a-dish” studies use “Matrigel” as the underlying scaffold that spontaneously causes plaque, and then tangle formation in a dish. Matrigel mostly contains large amounts of perlecan, the same specific HSPG implicated in AD and amyloid disorders. Mucopolysaccharidoses caused by lack of specific HS GAG enzymes lead to massive accumulation of HS in lysosomal compartments in neurons and contribute to cognitive impairment in children. Neurons full of HS demonstrate marked accumulation and fibrillization of Aβ, tau, α-synuclein, and prion protein (PrP) in mucopolysaccharidosis animal models demonstrating that HS GAG accumulation is a precursor to Aβ accumulation in neurons. Brain aging leads to changes in HSPGs, including newly identified splice variants leading to increased HS GAG sulfation in the AD brain. All of these events lead to the new “Unifying Hypothesis of Alzheimer’s disease” that further implicates HSPGs /HS GAGs as key (as first hypothesized by Snow and Wight in 1989).}

It is unclear whether the clinical correlation between the two diseases might be due to shared risk factors or the influence of one disorder on the other. Interestingly, certain observations may provide a clue towards a better understanding of the high rate of comorbidity reported between AD and glaucoma. In this article, we hypothesise that there may be a causal relationship between AD and glaucoma that may be explained by decreased cerebrospinal fluid pressure (CSFP) in patients with AD. A very recent study reported the intriguing new observation that mean CSFP was 33\% lower in subjects with primary open-angle glaucoma than that of non-glaucomatous controls. It was noted that this observation supports the concept that an abnormal high trans-lamina cribrosa pressure difference, whether the result of elevated intraocular pressure, reduced CSFP, or both, plays an important role in glaucomatous optic nerve damage. Interestingly, it was also reported that a substantial proportion of AD patients have very low CSFP. Therefore, we hypothesise that an abnormal high trans-lamina cribrosa pressure difference may explain why patients with AD have a greater risk for developing glaucoma.},

    abstract = "{Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is a significant risk factor for glaucoma, the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. While previous studies have identified numerous genetic variants associated with IOP, these loci only explain a fraction of IOP heritability. Recently established of biobank repositories have resulted in large amounts of data, enabling the identification of the remaining heritability for complex traits. Here, we describe the largest genome-wide association study of IOP to date using participants of European ancestry from the UK Biobank. We identified 671 directly genotyped variants that are significantly associated with IOP (P \\&lt; 5 × 10−8). In addition to 103 novel loci, the top ranked novel IOP genes are LMX1B, NR1H3, MADD and SEPT9. We replicated these findings in an external population and examined the pleiotropic nature of these loci. These discoveries not only further our understanding of the genetic architecture of IOP, but also shed new light on the biological processes underlying glaucoma.}",
